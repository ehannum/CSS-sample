Design Sampler
============

Tool for sampling and analyzing graphic and web design choices, such as color scheme and font pairings, from the web using HTML5.

DOES NOT WORK! Just exists as a tiny proof of concept of one of the minor features.

PLANNED:
 [ ] Assemble full color profile for a selected website.
 [ ] Identify fonts and font pairings.
 [ ] Chrome addon for sampling websites on the fly.
 [ ] Leveraging Behance API to identify high quality, current, and possibly user-specific data samples.
 [ ] Lots of other possibilities that are too far off to speculate about.
