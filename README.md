"The colors, dook, the colors!"

Tool for sampling and analyzing graphic and web design choices, such as color scheme and font pairings, from the web using HTML5.

Made at the HACK REACTOR 48 Hour Hackathon in San Francisco.

available to try at -> http://css-sampler.herokuapp.com

Working a lot of the time but some sites do weird things like not end their CSS files with .css

Will compensate in future versions.

PLANNED:
 [kinda ] - Assemble full color profile for a selected website.
 [ ish  ] - Identify fonts and font pairings.
 [ nope ] - Chrome addon for sampling websites on the fly.
 [  no  ] - Leveraging Behance API to identify high quality, current, and possibly user-specific data samples.
 [ sure ] - Lots of other possibilities that are too far off to speculate about.
