============
"The colors, dook, the colors!"

Web application that data mines and analyzes style information from the web to construct design profiles including color scheme and font pairings. Utilizes custom algorithms for analyzing color information and assembling a representative color scheme based on comparisons of hue, saturation, and luminosity.

Made at a Hack Reactor 48-Hour Hackathon in San Francisco.

Working a lot of the time but some sites do weird things like not end their CSS files with .css or not end their lines with a semicolon somehow.

Will compensate in future versions.

PLANNED:
* [mostly] - Assemble full color profile for a selected website.
* [mostly] - Identify fonts and font pairings.
* [nuh-uh] - Database for storing popular websites and aggregating current trends.
* [ nope ] - Chrome addon for sampling websites on the fly.
* [  no  ] - Leveraging Behance API to identify high quality, current, and possibly user-specific data samples.
* [ sure ] - Lots of other possibilities that are too far off to speculate about.
