CSS-sampler
============

Tool for sampling and analyzing graphic design choices, such as color scheme and font pairings, from a given website using HTML5.

DOES NOT WORK! Just exists as a tiny proof of concept of one of the minor features.

PLANNED:
 - Assemble full color profile for a selected website.
 - Identify fonts and font pairings.
 - Chrome addon for sampling websites on the fly.
 - Lots of other possibilities that are too far off to speculate about.
